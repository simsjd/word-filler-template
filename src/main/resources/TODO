Overall:
	Authenticate per user from Mule to Sharepoint? (Long term, but since sf to mule is connected app can't for now)
	Update to dynamically check for folder structure and create as needed
		Folder structure will be /"Object"/"recordId"/
	Generate better raml file, adding examples, type, etc
	Revisit API kit router configuration
	possible increase default memory size since working with documents
	Require authentication from sf to mule
